# Person_Re-identification

Abstract:
   The increasing demand for public safety and the rapid development of intelligent surveillance networks, person re-identification (Re-ID) has become one of the hot research topics in the computer vision field. Person re-identification (Re-ID) has a wide range of applications which adds its popularity in recent studies. The main research goal of person Re-ID is to retrieve persons with the same identity from different cameras. Some challenges are still existing in the open world. First, the existing re-ID research usually assumes only one-factor variable (view, clothing, pedestrian pose, pedestrian occlusion, image resolution, RGB/IR modality) changing, ignoring the complexity of multi-factor variables in the open world. Second, the existing re-ID methods are over-dependent on clothing color and other apparent features of pedestrians, which are easily disguised or changed. In addition, the lack of benchmark datasets containing multi-factor variables is also hindering the practical application of re-ID in the open world. The proposed model uses two stream convolutional network (TSF â€“ CNN) to extract the features and a similarity measure score is used to re-identify the person. The evaluation metrics used are Cumulative Matching Characteristics (CMC) and mean Average Precision (mAP).
